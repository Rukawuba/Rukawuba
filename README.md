- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rukawuba
- 👀 I’m interested in ... .NET , C# , and front end technologies like JavaScript, Angular , and React. Maybe plan on learning more.. But for right now that is the main focus.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Angular and how I can integrate it with NodeJS as well as .NET CORE
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... applications that are tied with sports. Specifically basketball, but open to hearing and collaborating about any other ideas. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can reach me here or at my email of rcu3@njit.edu

I have been back and forth with coding and I want the next three years to really lock in and see how far I can take it.
I enjoy basketball, traveling, business ventures, and looking to create an app that encompasses all of those.
Currently in Spain playing basketball. Looking to prove something to myself.
