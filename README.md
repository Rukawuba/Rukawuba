##Basketball Data Scientist & Analytics Engineer 🏀📊

Former professional basketball player transitioning into basketball analytics, data engineering, and performance science.  
I build end-to-end data pipelines, analytical models, and decision-support tools using real basketball data — focused on lineups, player impact, game context, and movement analytics.

My work sits at the intersection of **basketball intuition**, **statistical modeling**, and **practical engineering** — with the goal of supporting coaching, scouting, and front-office decision-making.

## ⭐ Featured Projects

### 🏀 NBA Lineup Stint & Game Context Analysis
**NBA play-by-play → lineup stints → possession-level metrics**

Built a pipeline that reconstructs lineup stints from NBA play-by-play data and evaluates on-court impact using:
- Net Rating
- Points per Possession
- Score Differential Change
- Pace & stint duration

The project focuses on **momentum swings, rotation effectiveness, and lineup context**, rather than full-game box scores — reflecting how coaches and analysts actually evaluate games.

**Tech:** Python · NBA API · SQL · pandas · visualization  
👉 Useful for post-game review, rotation evaluation, and opponent prep

---

### 🏀 Player Impact & On/Off Evaluation
Developed tools to quantify player impact using:
- On/off splits
- Context-aware lineup metrics
- Usage-based efficiency indicators

This project explores how player value changes depending on lineup context — not just raw box-score production.

**Tech:** Python · pandas · scikit-learn  
👉 Bridges film intuition with quantitative evaluation

### 🧠 Biomechanics Motion-Capture Pipeline (MediaPipe / OpenPose)
Built a motion-analysis pipeline using markerless pose estimation to extract joint-level movement data from video.

- Extracted 2D joint keypoints
- Engineered kinematic metrics (hip/knee angles, asymmetry, movement efficiency)
- Designed structured storage and anomaly detection
- Currently building practitioner-facing dashboards

**Tech:** Python · MediaPipe / OpenPose · SQL · Dash / Streamlit  
👉 Applicable to performance optimization, injury risk screening, and return-to-play monitoring

---

### 🏗 Real-World Data Engineering & Modeling Projects
Additional projects focused on:
- Real-estate price prediction (Madrid market)
- Data cleaning and feature engineering pipelines
- Regression and predictive modeling with imperfect real-world data

Built to emphasize **data quality, explainability, and reproducibility** rather than academic perfection.

## 📈 How I Think About Basketball Analytics
- Context matters more than totals  
- Short stints reveal more than full-game averages  
- Models must be **explainable to coaches and decision-makers**  
- Data should support — not replace — basketball intuition  

My background as a professional player directly shapes how I frame analytical problems and interpret results.

---

## 🚀 What I’m Working Toward
- Advanced lineup impact models (RAPM-style)
- Win probability & game-state modeling
- Tracking-data inspired movement analytics
- Scalable tooling for team & staff usage

Ultimately: contributing to an NBA or pro-level analytics group where data directly influences on-court decisions.
