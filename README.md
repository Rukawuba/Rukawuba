# Basketball Data Scientist & Analytics Engineer 🏀📊

Former professional basketball player turning into basketball analytics, data engineering, and performance science.  
I build end-to-end data pipelines, analytical models, and decision-support tools using real basketball data — focused on lineups, player impact, game context, and movement analytics.

My work sits at the intersection of **basketball intuition**, **statistical modeling**, and **practical engineering** — with the goal of supporting coaching, scouting, and front-office decision-making.

## 📈 How I Think About Basketball Analytics
- Context matters more than totals  
- Short stints reveal more than full-game averages  
- Data should aid — not replace — basketball intuition  

My background as a professional player directly shapes how I frame analytical problems and interpret results.

## 🚀 What I’m Working Toward
- Advanced lineup impact models (RAPM-style)
- Win probability & game-state modeling
- Tracking-data inspired movement analytics
- Scalable tooling for team & staff usage
